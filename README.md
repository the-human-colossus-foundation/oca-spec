# How to contribute

## Major change

If you would like to introduce major change to the specification, like adding objects, attributes, changing meta data etc, you can achieve that via RFCs. See details below. 

If you are not sure about the idea start with opening up Issue for collecting community feedback.

## Minor change

Minor changes like, refinement of the wording, improvments of the examples, references etc, can be done via regular PR directly to the specification without need for community debates.
Minor changes includes as well any type of bugs and errors in the spec like typo or mistakes in the formating.


# RFC - Request for comments

The spec is built upon commited RFC's into this repository.

## RFC lifecycle

### PROPOSED
To propose an RFC, use these instructions to raise a PR against the repo. Proposed RFCs are considered a "work in progress", even after they are merged. In other words, they haven't been endorsed by the community yet, but they seem like reasonable ideas worth exploring.

### DEMONSTRATED
Demonstrated RFCs have one or more implementations available, listed in the "Implementations" section of the RFC document. As with the PROPOSED status, demonstrated RFCs haven't been endorsed by the community, but the ideas put forth have been more thoroughly explored through the implementation(s). The demonstrated status is an optional step in the lifecycle.

### ACCEPTED
To get an RFC accepted, build consensus for your RFC on chat and in community meetings. An accepted RFC is incubating on a standards track; the community has decided to polish it and is exploring or pursuing implementation.

### ADOPTED

Adopted is acknowledgment of a de facto standard and would be incorporated into the OCA specification. After that process the RFCs would be archived.

## Acknowledgement

The structure and a lot of the initial language of this repository was borrowed from [Indy HIPEs](

Their good work has made the setup of this repository much quicker and better than it otherwise would have been.
