    <p>
      The post millennial generation has witnessed an explosion of captured data
      points which has sparked profound possibilities in both Artificial
      Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. This has spawned
      the collective realization that society’s current technological
      infrastructure is simply not equipped to fully protect personally
      identifiable information (PII) or to entice corporations to break down
      internal data silos, streamline data harmonization processes and
      ultimately resolve worldwide data duplication and storage resource issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      The FAIR Data Principles are a set of guiding principles in order to make
      data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (Wilkinson et al.,
      2016). These principles provide guidance for scientific data management
      and stewardship and are relevant to all stakeholders in the current
      digital ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p>
      In line with the FAIR principles, data harmonization
      and interoperability processes between internal departments and functions
      is a high priority for corporate organizations but the current cognitive
      framework available for data capture across all industry sectors is
      hampered by limitations to the foundational data object architecture.
