## Conventions and Definitions

Sections marked as non-normative, along with all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification, are for informational purposes only and are not mandatory for compliance. All other sections of this specification are normative and define the required rules and standards that must be followed to ensure conformity with the OCA Specification.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as described in RFC 2119 \[[RFC2119](#ref-RFC2119)\].

## Introduction

_This section is non-normative._

### How does OCA work?

OCA is based on the FAIR data principles \[[FAIR2016](#ref-FAIR2016)\], a set of guiding principles to make data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable, to enable scientific data management and stewardship, and to be relevant to all digital economy stakeholders.

OCA represents transient objects (domain-agnostic) and persistent schemas (domain-specific) as multi-dimensional objects consisting of a stable capture base and interoperable overlays. By introducing overlays as linked task-specific objects within the schema stack, the architecture offers an optimal level of efficiency and interoperability in alignment with FAIR principles.

#### What is a Capture Base?

A [Capture Base](#capture-base) is the purest and simplest form of a schema, defining the structural characteristics of a dataset. It is the foundational layer upon which to bind task-specific objects to enhance the meaning of inputted data.

#### What are Overlays?

[Overlays](#overlays) are task-specific objects that provide cryptographically-bound layers of definitional or contextual metadata to a [Capture Base](#capture-base). Any actor interacting with a published [Capture Base](#capture-base) can use [Overlays](#overlays) to enrich meaning of the data, transform how inputted data and metadata are displayed to a viewer or guide an agent in applying a custom process to captured data.

## OCA object types

An `OCA object` is either a [Capture Base](#capture-base) or a task-specific [Overlay](#overlays) with a deterministic relationship to a [Capture Base](#capture-base) or another [Overlay](#overlays). When amalgamated as a [Bundle](#bundle), OCA objects provide the necessary structural, definitional, and contextual information to determine the meaning of inputted data at the time of data capture.

### Capture Base

A `Capture Base` is a base object that defines a single dataset in its purest form, providing a structural base to harmonise data. The object defines attribute names and types.

The Capture Base comprises the following attributes, listed in order to form its canonical serialization:

- `d` - [deterministic identifier](#deterministic-identifier) of the capture base
- [ type ](#type)
- [ attributes ](#attributes)

```json
{
  "d": "EFEDyA__ap51wscacOwATP3c51icUeHT6D0tTbInQI9G",
  "type": "spec/capture_base/1.0.0",
  "attributes": {
    "dateOfBirth": "DateTime",
    "documentNumber": "Text",
    "documentType": "Array[Text]",
    "fullName": "Text",
    "height": "Numeric",
    "issuingState": "Text",
    "photoImage": "Binary",
    "sex": "Text"
  },
}
```

_Example 1. Code snippet for a Capture Base._

#### Type

The `type` attribute specifies the schema object type and its associated version. The version aligns with the corresponding OCA specification version, ensuring that the schema object remains compatible with the specified OCA specification.

```abnf
type = "spec/capture_base/" sem_ver
sem_ver = DIGIT "." DIGIT "." DIGIT
```

_Listing: ABNF core rules \[[RFC5234](#ref-RFC5234)\]_

#### Attributes

The `attributes` attribute maps key-value pairs where the key is the attribute name and the value is the attribute type.

##### Attribute name

An attribute name is a string that uniquely identifies an attribute within an OCA layer and is used to reference that attribute by other layers throughout the OCA bundle. The string can be any valid Unicode code point.
Example of a valid attribute name:
- `FullName`
- `person/name/fullName`
- `王小明`
- `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`

```abnf
string = 1*(character)
character = %x0000-10FFFF
```

_Listing: ABNF representation of the attribute name_


##### Attribute type

An attribute type determines the attribute's syntax and how attributes of that type are compared and sorted. A Capture Base recognises seven core data types:

- **Numeric**: a data type that defines anything relating to or containing
numbers. Examples of numeric data types include 8-byte integers, fixed precision
and scale numeric data, floating precision number data, integer (whole number)
data, and monetary data values.
- **Reference**: a data type that defines a Self-Addressing IDentifier
([SAID](#ref-SAID)) that references a set of attributes through its associated
parent. For example, the `reference` data type enables the development of nested
data objects, where the organisation of information is in layers or where
objects contain other similar objects.
- **Boolean**: a data type where the data only has two possible variables: true
or false. In computer science, Boolean is an identification classifier for
calculating logical truth values and algebraic variables.
- **Binary**: a data type that defines a binary code signal, a series of
electrical pulses representing numbers, characters, and performed operations.
Based on a binary number system, each digit position represents a power of two
(e.g., 4, 8, 16, etc.). A set of four binary digits or bits in binary code
represents each decimal number (0 to 9). Each digit has two possible states: off
and on (usually symbolised by 0 and 1). Combining basic Boolean algebraic
operations on binary numbers makes it possible to represent each of the four
fundamental arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division.
- **DateTime**: a data type that defines the number of seconds or clock ticks
that have elapsed since the defined epoch for that computer or platform. Common
formats include dates (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD), times (e.g., hh:mm:ss), dates and
times concatenated (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sss+zz:zz`), and durations (e.g.,
`PnYnMnD`).
- **Array[data type]**: a data type that defines a structure that holds several
data items or elements of the same data type. When you want to store many pieces
of data that are related and have the same data type, it is often better to use
an array instead of many separate variables (e.g., `Array[Text]`,
`Array[Numeric]`, etc.).

### Overlays

`Overlay` as a task-specific object provides layers of definitional or contextual metadata. OCA specification recognize two core types of overlays:
- [Semantic overlays](#semantic-overlays) - provide contextual meaning to describe objects and their relationships.
- [Inputs overlays](#inputs-overlays) - provide predefined inputs for data attestations.

In the context of this specification, these are considered **core overlays**, which, through **community consensus**, are deemed the most essential for inclusion and are among the most commonly used.

The **OCA Specification** intentionally limits the number of **predefined core
overlays** to a **minimum**, allowing the community to take the lead in
developing additional overlays as needed. This approach fosters a **dominant
design** process, enabling the community to determine which **task-specific
overlays** are most meaningful and valuable. See [Community overlays](#community-overlays) for more details.

#### Mandatory attributes

Overlays are cryptographically-linked objects that provide layers of task-oriented definitional or contextual information to a other [OCA Objects](#oca-object-types). Any actor interacting with a published Capture Base can use Overlays to add metadata to the underlying object, transform how information is displayed to a viewer, or guide an agent in applying a custom process to captured data.

Overlays `MUST` comprises the following attributes, listed in order to form its canonical serialization:
- `d` - [deterministic identifier](#deterministic-identifier) of the overlay
- [ capture_base ](#capture-base-1) or [overlay](#overlay)
- [ type ](#type-1)
- Overlay-specific attributes sorted in lexicographic order
  - See specific overlay types for more information.

##### Capture base

The `capture_base` attribute contains the [SAID](#ref-SAID)  of the [Capture Base](#capture-base) to cryptographically anchor to that parent object.

##### Overlay

The `overlay` attribute contains the [SAID](#ref-SAID) of the [Overlay](#overlays) to cryptographically anchor to that parent object.

##### Type

The `type` attribute identifies the schema object type. The version aligns with the corresponding OCA specification version, ensuring that the object remains compatible with the specified OCA specification.

```abnf
type = "("spec" / "community)/overlays/" overlay_name "/" sem_ver
overlay_name = namespace ":" ALPHA / ALPHA
namespace = ALPHA
sem_ver = DIGIT "." DIGIT "." DIGIT
```

_Listing: ABNF core rules_

`spec` should be used when the object is defined by core specification and `community` when it is community defined object.

#### Common attributes

##### Language

To indicate language-specific information, some overlays would include a `language` attribute to indicate localization of that overlay.
Those overlays are marked in the specification as `[lagnauge-specific object]`

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) \[[ISO](#ref-ISO)\] has standardised two lists of language-related codes: the language codes called ISO 639-1 alpha-2 \[[ISO639](#ref-ISO639)\] codes ("Codes for the representation of names of languages") and ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 \[[ISO3166](#ref-ISO3166)\] codes ("Codes for the representation of names of countries"). Both consist of two letters. The language code is written in lowercase while the country code is written in uppercase. However, both ISO classifications may be combined to differentiate regional languages.

The `language` attribute MUST contain either the two-letter language code (lowercase) for a national language or the combined language (lowercase)/country (uppercase) code for a regional language or locale.

![Table 1](/images/spec-table1.png)
_Table 1. An example of ISO standard values for language and combined language/country codes._


### Semantic Overlays
Semantic overlays provide contextual meaning to describe objects and their relationships.

##### Character Encoding Overlay

A Character Encoding Overlay defines the process of assigning numbers to graphical characters, especially the written characters of human language, allowing them to be stored, transmitted, and transformed using digital computers. Character encoding using internationally accepted standards permits worldwide interchange of text in electronic form.

In addition to the [Mandatory attributes](#mandatory-attributes), the Character Encoding Overlay MUST include at least one of the following attributes:

- `default_character_encoding`

  The "default_character_encoding" attribute specifies the default character encoding for the attributes contained in the parent Capture Base.

  The most common default character set is UTF-8 \[[RFC3629](#ref-RFC3629)\], which accounts for 98% of all web pages in the World Wide Web and up to 100.0% for some languages, as of 2021.

- `attr_character_encoding`

  The `attr_character_encoding` attribute maps key-value pairs where the key is the attribute name and the value is the character encoding.

  Any attributes contained in the `attr_character_encoding` attribute override the behaviour of the `default_character_encoding` attribute.

  There are many encoding standards including Base64 \[[RFC4648](#ref-RFC4648)\], UTF-8, and ASCII to name a few. Each standard has a purpose, and applications using those encoding standards expect to receive data compliant with that encoding standard. The most popular types of character encoding are ASCII and Unicode \[[UNICODE](#ref-UNICODE)\]. While ASCII is still supported by nearly all text editors, Unicode is more commonly used because it supports a larger character set. Unicode is often defined as UTF-8, UTF-16 \[[RFC2781](#ref-RFC2781)\], or UTF-32 \[[ISO10646](#ref-ISO10646)\], which refer to different Unicode standards.

    "attribute_character_encoding": {
      "photoImage": "base64"
    }
  }
  ```

  _Example 2. Code snippet for a Character Encoding Overlay._

##### Format Overlay

A Format Overlay defines an input and display format for data fields. The data format enables conversion of the input buffer to the program variable and displays program variable data to form fields.

In addition to the [Mandatory attributes](#mandatory-attributes), the Format Overlay MUST include the following attribute:

- `attribute_formats`

  The "attribute_formats" attribute maps key-value pairs where the key is the attribute name and the value is the format.

The inputted format values are dependent on the following core data types as defined by the attribute types in the Capture Base:

- **Text**: The inputted format value for this core data type MAY be a regular expression [REGEX], a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern in text.

- **Binary**: The inputted format value for this core data type MAY be a MIME type registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) \[[IANA](#ref-IANA)\]

- **DateTime**: The inputted format value for this core data type MAY be a date and time representation as defined by ISO 8601, a standard for the worldwide exchange and communication of date and time-related data.

```json
{
  "d": "EIpe9Ra0tUWTPFrZU-Jo_EufovDqrbFOgwc2YppvTvFD",
  "capture_base": "EVyoqPYxoPiZOneM84MN-7D0oOR03vCr5gg1hf3pxnis",
  "type": "spec/overlays/format/1.0.2",
  "attribute_formats": {
    "dateOfBirth": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "documentNumber": "[A-Z0-9]{9}",
    "photoImage": "image/jpeg",
    "sex": "[A-Z]{1}"
  }
}
```

_Example 3. Code snippet for a Format Overlay._

##### Label Overlay

_[language-specific object]_

A Label Overlay defines human readable attribute names. For example, for an attribute named `dateOfBirth`, you may wish to call it `Date of birth`, which is more meaningful and user-friendly when inspected by human.

In addition to the [Mandatory attributes](#mandatory-attributes) and [language](#language), the Label Overlay MUST include the following attribute:

- `attribute_labels`

  The `attribute_labels` attribute maps key-value pairs where the key is the attribute name and the value is a human-meaningful attribute label in a specific language.

```json
{
  "d": "EPstaptvuTLvr6r2b0JBLzxaQzMZKkcKaYZBQTYPrdaL",
  "capture_base": "EVyoqPYxoPiZOneM84MN-7D0oOR03vCr5gg1hf3pxnis",
  "type": "spec/overlays/label/1.0.2",
  "language": "en_UK",
  "attribute_labels": {
    "dateOfBirth": "Date of birth",
    "documentNumber": "Passport Number",
    "documentType": "Document",
    "fullName": "Name",
    "height": "Height",
    "issuingState": "Issuing State or organization (in full)",
    "photoImage": "Portrait image",
    "sex": "Sex"
  }
}
```

_Example 5. Code snippet for a Label Overlay (language: en)._

##### Meta Overlay

_[language-specific object]_

A Meta Overlay defines any language-specific information about a schema. It is used for discovery and identification and includes elements such as the schema name and description.

In addition to the [Mandatory attributes](#mandatory-attributes) and [language](#language), the Meta Overlay SHOULD include the following attributes:

- `name`

  The `name` attribute contains the name of the schema in a specific language.

- `description `

  The `description` attribute contains a description of the schema in a specific language.

and MAY include other attributes at the discretion of the overlay producer, such as an "affiliation" attribute in the example below. How the overlay producer conveys the purpose of the additional attributes in the Meta Overlay is outside the scope of this specification.

```json
{
  "d": "EGzJ1hFOPWD1J5Bq2TA-NR0ssPunJJO_7uxngJNDXcXs",
  "capture_base": "EVyoqPYxoPiZOneM84MN-7D0oOR03vCr5gg1hf3pxnis",
  "type": "spec/overlays/meta/1.0.2",
  "language": "en_UK",
  "name": "Digital Passport",
  "description": "An example of a Digital Passport schema",
  "affiliation": "The Government of Antarctica"
}
```

_Example 6. Code snippet for a Meta Overlay (language: en_UK)._

##### Standard Overlay

A Standard Overlay defines a documented agreement or technical specification published by a standards organisation used to represent, format, define, structure, tag, transmit, manipulate, use, and manage data.

In addition to the [Mandatory attributes](#mandatory-attributes), the Standard Overlay MUST include the following attribute:

- `attr_standards`

  The `attr_standards` attribute maps key-value pairs where the key is the attribute name and the value is the standard.

There are many international standards organisations establishing tens of thousands of standards covering almost every conceivable topic. The three largest and most well-established standards organisations are the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) \[[IEC](#ref-IEC)\], and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) \[[ITU](#ref-ITU)\]. Standards tend to contain the acronym of the standards organisation followed by an internal document identifier.

```json
{
  "d": "EMd8KksaUfkmfzzTJBx4gsTz0d8JaId3Lj4otsY9stXg",
  "capture_base": "EVyoqPYxoPiZOneM84MN-7D0oOR03vCr5gg1hf3pxnis",
  "type": "spec/overlays/standard/1.0.2",
  "attr_standards": {
    "dateOfBirth": "ISO 8601"
  }
}
```

_Example 7. Code snippet for a Standard Overlay._

#### Inputs Overlays

Inputs overlays provide predefined inputs for data attestations.

##### Cardinality Overlay

A Cardinality Overlay defines the minimum and maximum number of values that an attribute can have. For a relationship, the cardinality interval specifies the minimum and maximum number of relationship targets.

In addition to the [Mandatory attributes](#mandatory-attributes), the Cardinality Overlay MUST include the following attribute:

- `attr_cardinality`

  The `attr_cardinality` attribute maps key-value pairs where the key is the attribute name and the value is the cardinality interval.

The logic of cardinality intervals is as follows:

- `n` : The cardinality interval denotes exactly `n` entries;
- `n-` : The cardinality interval denotes a minimum of `n` entries;
- `n-m` : The cardinality interval denotes a minimum of `n` and maximum of `m` entries;
- `-m` : The cardinality interval denotes a maximum of `m` entries.

Note that `n` and `m` are positive integers.

```json
{
  "d": "EMWxTY5PLoPOtyb-XgiB3BiRpqlHhxRTW7hqAI50UFsl",
  "capture_base": "EVyoqPYxoPiZOneM84MN-7D0oOR03vCr5gg1hf3pxnis",
  "type": "spec/overlays/cardinality/1.0.2",
  "attr_cardinality": {
    "documentType": "1-2"
  }
}
```

_Example 8. Code snippet for a Cardinality Overlay._

##### Conformance Overlay

A Conformance Overlay indicates whether data entry for each attribute is mandatory or optional.

In addition to the [Mandatory attributes](#mandatory-attributes), the Conformance Overlay MAY include the following attributes:

- `attribute_conformance `

  The `attribute_conformance` attribute maps key-value pairs where the key is the attribute name and the value is the data entry conformance of the attribute, which is set to either `M` (mandatory) or `O` (optional).

```json
{
  "d": "EIP9FA6J_fvw0wjnvjPVQqkoYol627D-NdvkhptxfyDM",
  "capture_base": "EVyoqPYxoPiZOneM84MN-7D0oOR03vCr5gg1hf3pxnis",
  "type": "spec/overlays/conformance/1.0.2",
  "attribute_conformance": {
    "dateOfBirth": "M",
    "documentNumber": "M",
    "documentType": "M",
    "fullName": "M",
    "height": "O",
    "issuingState": "M",
    "photoImage": "M",
    "sex": "M"
  }
}
```

_Example 10. Code snippet for a Conformance Overlay._

##### Entry Code Overlay

An Entry Code Overlay defines the entry keys in a series of key-value pairs stored in a code table (also known as a "lookup table") or dataset. The key is a unique identifier that points to its associated value.

![Table 2](/images/spec-table2.png)
_Table 2. An example of how the values in an array of key-value pairs provided by an Entry Code Overlay subsequently define a set of pre-defined entry keys in a nested series of key-value pairs. The specified values are often standardised categorisation codes, valuable data inputs for statistical analysis, machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms._

In addition to the [Mandatory attributes](#mandatory-attributes), the Entry Code Overlay MUST include the following attribute:

- `attribute_entry_codes `

  The `attribute_entry_codes` attribute maps key-value pairs where the key is the attribute name and the value is either:

  - a set of pre-defined entry keys for a nested series of key-value pairs; or

  - a [SAID](#ref-SAID) that references a code table from an external data source to retrieve an array of pre-defined entry keys for a nested series of key-value pairs. See [Code Tables](#code-tables) for more information on code tables.

```json
{
  "d": "EPiSWiwDzZCVvXSSs2icINxtHC1_S7gKzhFylVz7iGw0",

    "sex": ["F", "M", "X"]
  }
}
```

_Example 11. Code snippet for an Entry Code Overlay._

##### Entry Overlay

_[language-specific object]_

An Entry Overlay defines the entry values in a series of key-value pairs stored in a code table (also known as a "lookup table") or dataset. A value is either the identified data or a pointer to that data.

![Table 3](/images/spec-table3.png)
_Table 3. An example of how an Entry Overlay can leverage a set of pre-defined entry keys in a nested series of key-value pairs provided by an Entry Code Overlay to provide human-meaningful values in a specified national or regional language._

In addition to the [Mandatory attributes](#mandatory-attributes), and [languag](#language), the Entry Overlay MUST include the following attribute:

- `attribute_entries`

  The `attribute_entries` attribute maps key-value pairs where the key is the attribute name and the value is either:

  - a set of pre-defined values in a nested series of key-value pairs that are human-meaningful and language-dependent where the entry keys are taken from an associated Entry Code Overlay; or

  - a [SAID](#ref-SAID) that references a code table from an external data source to retrieve an array of pre-defined values from a nested series of key-value pairs that are human-meaningful and language-dependent where the entry keys are taken from an associated Entry Code Overlay. See [Code Tables](#code-tables) for more information.

    }
  }
}
```

##### Unit Overlay

A Unit Overlay defines the units of measurement adopted by convention or law, used as a standard for measuring the same kind of quantitative data. The RECOMMENDED system to use is the International System of Units (SI) \[[BIPM](#ref-BIPM)\], French Système International d’Unités, an international decimal system of weights and measures derived from and extending the metric system of units.

Adopted by the 11th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) in 1960, it is abbreviated SI in all languages. To date, the SI comprises seven base units: the meter (m), the kilogram (kg), the second (s), the ampere (A), the kelvin (K), the candela (cd) and the mole (mol).

![Fig 3](/images/spec-fig3.png)

_Figure 3. The seven defining constants of the SI._

In addition to the [Mandatory attributes](#mandatory-attributes), the Unit Overlay SHOULD include the following attribute:

- `metric_system`

  The `metric_system` attribute contains the acronym of the chosen system of units (a coherent system of units of measurement) used for defining attribute units.

and MUST include the following attribute:

- `attribute_units`

  The `attribute_units` attribute maps key-value pairs where the key is the attribute name and the value is a standard unit of measurement from a known metric system.

  "metric_system": "SI",
  "attribute_units": {
    "height": "cm"
  }
}
```

_Example 13. Code snippet for a Unit Overlay._

##### Attribute Mapping Overlay

An Attribute Mapping Overlay defines attribute mappings between two distinct data models. Data mapping provides a preliminary step for data integration tasks, including data transformation or data mediation between a data source and a destination or consolidation of multiple databases into a single database and identifying redundant columns of data for consolidation or elimination.

```json
{

      "ATG:AG",
    ]
  }
}
```

##### Subset Overlay

A Subset Overlay defines a customised version of a published schema containing a subset of source attributes, including their properties, types, codes, and relationship dependencies required for the information exchange.

```json
{
  "d": "ENyLjLiRetRlaDqcEASwMnk6jDKIx7ylXDB8GOfqc0d5",
  "capture_base": "EVyoqPYxoPiZOneM84MN-7D0oOR03vCr5gg1hf3pxnis",
  "type": "spec/overlays/subset/1.0.2",
  "attributes": ["dateOfBirth", "documentNumber", "documentType"]
}
```

_Example 16. Code snippet for a Subset Overlay._

##### Sensitive Overlay

A Sensitive Overlay is a specialized construct used to identify and flag attributes that require protection against unauthorized or unwarranted disclosure. Attributes marked by a Sensitive Overlay typically include data subject to legal, ethical, or privacy-related considerations, including but not limited to Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Quasi-Identifiable Information (QII)) or proprietary information.

Sensitive Overlays are integral to ensuring compliance with legal and ethical standards while supporting robust data governance. Implementers must incorporate mechanisms to respect and enforce the protections designated by these overlays to maintain conformity with the OCA Specification.

The Blinding Identity Taxonomy (BIT) [KAN2020](#ref-KAN2020) is a practical tool for any practitioner whose organisation has custody or control of a dataset containing identifiable information about entities, including a natural person, organisation, or device with signing capabilities that make that entity uniquely identifiable. For example, data protection officers and schema issuers can use the BIT to flag a list of elements which require cryptographic encoding to reduce the risk of identifying a data principal.


In addition to the `capture_base` and `type` attributes (see [Common attributes](#common-attributes)), the Sensitive Overlay MUST include the following attribute:

- `attributes`

  The `attributes` attribute is an array of attributes considered sensitive.

```json
{
  "d": "EKzY_KAP0U05dQ4_radjWu1TkbBFOh50wIgAEKTNP9R2",
  "capture_base": "EVyoqPYxoPiZOneM84MN-7D0oOR03vCr5gg1hf3pxnis",
  "type": "spec/overlays/sensitive/1.0",
  "attributes": ["first_name", "last_name"]
}
```

_Example 19. Code snippet for a Sensitive Overlay_

#### Community Overlays

Community overlays are task-specific objects which are integral part of OCA Bundle.
Defined by the community can be used to extend functionality of [OCA
Bundle](#bundle).

Community overlay needs to adhere to the OCA specification and MUST include
[Mandatory attributes](#mandatory-attributes) and MAY include [Common
attributes](#common-attributes) if necessary follwed by any overlay specific attributes.

The **canonical form** of a **community overlay** follows the same rules as the
**canonical form** of the **core overlay**.

### Bundle

An OCA Bundle is a set of OCA objects which MUST included a `Capture Base` and
MAY consist of any number of `Overlays`. An encoded cryptographic digest of the
contained objects produces a [deterministic
identifier](#deterministic-identifier) for the bundle.

#### Canonical form

OCA Bundles MUST be serializable to be transferred over the network. The
serialization algorithm MUST be deterministic and operate on the canonical form
of the Bundle, which ensures proper ordering of the attributes within OCA
Objects. The serialization algorithm consists of the following rules:

- MUST consist of following attributes in this order: `v`, `d`, `capture_base`, `overlays`
  - `v` - version string defined per section [Bundle Version](#bundle-version)
  - `d` - deterministic identifier of the bundle
  - `capture_base` - the `Capture Base` object defined as per section [Capture Base](#capture-base)
  - `overlays` - an array, containing all the overlays, sorted ASC by the `d` attribute

##### Bundle Version

To ensure proper versioning and identification of bundles within the OCA
Specification, we define a standardized string format for the bundle version.
This format encodes critical metadata about the bundle, allowing for consistent
interpretation and management across implementations.

*Bundle Version String Format*

The bundle version string must adhere to the following format:

```
OCAS<major><minor><format><size>_
```

Where:

- `OCAS`: A fixed prefix indicating "OCA Structure". This identifies the string
as conforming to the OCA Specification's versioning scheme.
- `<major>`: A single-digit integer (0-9) representing the major version of the
specification. A change in the major version indicates backward-incompatible
updates to the structure.
- `<minor>`: A single-digit integer (0-9) representing the minor version of the
specification. A change in the minor version indicates backward-compatible
updates.
- `<format>`: A string denoting the serialization format of the bundle.
Supported format is: `JSON`: JavaScript Object Notation
- `<size>`: A six-digit, zero-padded integer representing the size of the object
in hex notation, size of the object is calculated with `d` field with dummy
characters the same lenght as the eventual derived value. The dummy character is
#, that is, ASCII 35 decimal (23 hex).
- '_': A version string terminator.

*Example*:

A valid bundle version string:
```
OCAS11JSON000646_
```

This indicates:
- `OCAS` it is a OCA Bundle.
- The major version is 1.
- The minor version is 1.
- The serialization format is JSON.
- The object size in base64 encoding is 646 bytes.

*Validation*

Consumers of the OCA Specification must implement validation logic to ensure the bundle version string:
- Matches the defined format and structure.
- Uses only supported serialization formats.
- Accurately represents the object's size in base64 encoding.

Validation failure must result in the rejection of the bundle as non-compliant with the specification.

*Example*:
```

_Example 20. Code snippet for an OCA Bundle._

### Deterministic Identifier

Within the scope of the OCA specification, Deterministic Identifiers are always
Self-Addressing Identifiers ([SAIDs](#ref-SAID)). These identifiers are encoded
using Base64 URL-safe characters. For detailed information on their
functionality, please refer to the [SAID](#ref-SAID) specification. Below, we
distill the most relevant aspects of SAIDs in the context of the OCA
specification.

#### How to calculate SAID:

1. Convert the object ([bundle](#bundle) or [capture base](#capture-base) or [overlay](#overlays))
into its canonical form, ensuring all whitespace is removed.
2. Replace the SAID field value in the serialization with a dummy string of the
same length as the chosen digest algorithm (e.g. BLAKE3-256 is 32 bytes, which
is 44 characters in Base64 URL-Safe). The dummy character is `#` (ASCII 35 in
decimal, 0x23 in hex). See [CESR](#ref-CESR) code tables for available algorithms.
3. Compute the digest of the modified serialization, which includes the dummy
SAID value.
4. Replace the dummy characters with the computed SAID value.

#### How to verify object

1. Convert the object ([bundle](#bundle) or [capture base](#capture-base) or [overlay](#overlays))
into its canonical form, ensuring all whitespace is removed.
2. Replace the SAID field value in the serialization with a dummy string of the
same length as the digest algorithm. Use the digest algorithm specified by the
[CESR](#ref-CESR) derivation code of the copied SAID. The dummy character is #
(ASCII 35 in decimal, 0x23 in hex).
3. Compute the digest of the modified serialization, which includes the dummy
SAID value. Use the digest algorithm specified by the CESR derivation code of
the copied SAID.
4. Replace the dummy characters with the computed SAID value.`


### Code Tables

A code table is an external dataset structured as either:

- an array of data; or
- a map of key-value pairs.

A code table MUST be identifiable, verifiable, and resolvable by a [SAID](#ref-SAID).

#### Code Table for Keys

A Code Table for Keys provides an anchor to a reusable dataset for a common
purpose, such as a list of country codes. Therefore, this object MAY be a
reference target in an Entry Code Overlay. See [Entry Code
Overlay](#entry-code-overlay) for more information.

A Code Table for Keys MUST include the following attribute:

- `keys`

  The `keys` attribute is an array of pre-defined entry keys for a nested series
  of key-value pairs. A key is a unique identifier that points to an associated
  value.

```json
{
  "keys": ["AF", "AL", "DZ", "AS", "AD", "AO", "AI", "AQ", "AG", "..."]
}
```

_Example 21. Code snippet for a Code Table for Keys, providing an anchor for, in this case, two-character ISO country codes._

#### Code Table for Key-Value pairs

A Code Table for Key-Value pairs provides a mapping of input values to output values.

A Code Table for Key-Value pairs MUST include the following attribute:

- `entries`

  The "entries" attribute is a map of key-value pairs, where the key is the input value (the source) and the value is the output value (the product).

```json
{
   "entries":{
      "AFG":"AF", "ALB":"AL", "DZA":"DZ", "ASM":"AS", "AND":"AD",
      "AGO":"AO", "AIA":"AI", "ATA":"AQ", "ATG":"AG", "..."
   }
}
```

_Example 22. Code snippet for a Code Table for Key-Value pairs, providing a mapping from, in this case, three-character to two-character ISO country codes._
