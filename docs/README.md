features:
  - title: Content driven
    details: Immutable objects backed by Self-Addressing Identifiers cryptographically bound to the content, assure about security and portability
  - title: Simplified data pooling
    details: Decoupling can occur at any time as overlays are linked objects. With all colouration definitions stored in the overlays, combining data from related sources becomes seamless.
  - title: Stable capture base
    details: All extension and colouration definitions are applied in the overlays, enabling issuers to edit one or more of the linked objects to create simple updates rather than reissue capture bases on an ongoing basis.
  - title: Flagged attributes
    details: Issuers can flag attributes in the capture base that could potentially unblind the identity of a governing entity
  - title: Internationalisation
    details: A separate linked data object captures character set encoding definitions. Thus, a single report definition can contain different attribute forms for different languages.
  - title: Credential presentation
    details: Support for flexible credential presentation, in secure and controled way
  - title: Composability
    details: Cryptographically linked objects allow for high reusability, nesting, and referencing already existing capture base increasing interoperability of created objects.
  - title: Data validation
    details: Ensure captured data records are OCA bundle schema compliant
  - title: Data transformation
    details: Datasets transformation using tranformation overlays
