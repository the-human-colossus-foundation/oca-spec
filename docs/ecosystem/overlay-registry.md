# Overlays Registry

The Overlays Repository is a community-driven project that develops and shares
task-specific overlays for the Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA). This
repository allows contributors to create, share, and find overlays that extend
and improve the functionality of Capture Bases and other overlays. This is
achieved by providing documentation and overlay definitions (`.overlayfile`).
