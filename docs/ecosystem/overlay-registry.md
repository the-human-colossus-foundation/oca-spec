# Overlays Registry

The Overlays Repository, a community-driven project to develop and share
task-specific overlays for the Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA). This
repository allows contributors to create, share and find overlays that extend
and improve the functionality of Capture Bases and other overlays. This is
achieved by providing documentation and overlay definitions `.overalyfile`.
