# 0006 - Standard Overlay Changes
- Authors: Carly Huitema / Paul Knowles
- Status: PROPOSED
- Status Note: none
- Supersedes: none

## Summary
An update to the standard overlay to ensure standards can be unambiguously identified and to harmonise the reference information to the framing overlay. 

## Motivation
Response to [issue #45](https://github.com/the-human-colossus-foundation/oca-spec/issues/45).

The standard overlay allows the addition of information to a schema to help users harmonize data inputs. Data may be required to be inputted in according to a standard, and there are many standards that users may want to incorporate into their schema. The standard overlay provides a specific location for this information, and the format for referencing the standard by using terms `standard_id`, `standard_label`, `standard_location`, and `standard_version`. If this overlay is not available then documentation of standards will likely be moved to numerous non-standard locations (e.g. attribute name ="Chemical_name_in_IUPAC_standard", or information="The inhibitor chemical used for the testing. Note, use the IUPAC chemical name"). It would be unfortunate if a schema's single information overlay becomes overburdened with multiple tasks for the user when a standards overlay meets this need.

The standard overlay should include more information to help users unambiguously identify the standards used in the schema. This will harmonize this overlay with the framing overlay use of framing references as well as complement the framing functionalities. There are frames for attributes, entry codes, and units. Entries that are not limited to a specific list but follow a specific standard would be addressed using the Standard overlay. Currently the standard specification permits only a single identifier, but not all standards can be unambiguously identified and found using a single identifier. A minimal set of metadata is necessary to be specific as to the exact standard being referenced. 

## Tutorial

The following should replace the [standard overlay](https://github.com/the-human-colossus-foundation/oca-spec/blob/master/docs/specification/README.md#standard-overlay)


##### Standard Overlay

A Standard Overlay defines a documented agreement or technical specification published by a standards organisation used to represent, format, define, structure, tag, transmit, manipulate, use, and manage data.

In addition to the `capture_base` and `type` attributes (see [Common attributes](#common-attributes)), the Standard Overlay MUST include the following attribute:

- `attr_standards`

  The `attr_standards` attribute contains the following key-value pairs for each attribute: `standard_id`, `standard_label`, `standard_location`, and `standard_version`.

There are many international standards organisations establishing tens of thousands of standards covering almost every conceivable topic. Standards MUST be referenced by the required value `standard_id` which should use (where available) persistent identifiers to reference the standard. Examples of persistent identifiers include URNs, PURLs, DOIs, and SAIDs. Other details about the standard are optional (`standard_label`, `standard_location`, and `standard_version`) and can help users identify and use the correct standard.

    }
  }
