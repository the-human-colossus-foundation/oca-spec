When studying a language, semantics refers to what individual words mean and what they mean when put together to form phrases or sentences. Data semantics focuses on how a data object represents a concept or object in the real world.</p><h3 id="what-is-decentralised-semantics" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-decentralised-semantics"><span>What is Decentralised semantics?</span></a></h3><p>Decentralised semantics is a term that describes the separation of semantic (“definitional”) and pragmatic (“contextual”) tasks into task-specific objects that, when combined, provide a digital representation of a complex object.</p><p>In data processing, metadata is definitional data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed within an application or environment.

An object is deemed deterministic if any operation’s result and final state depend solely on the initial state and the operation’s arguments. Object identifiers must be resolvable via the object&#39;s digest to be deemed deterministic.</p><h2 id="why-decentralise-semantics" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-decentralise-semantics"><span>Why decentralise semantics?</span></a></h2><p>Working across governance boundaries is tricky because there is no common language of communication between <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/digital-ecosystem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> digital ecosystems </a>.

This objective involves the morphologic ("structural"), semantic ("definitional"), and pragmatic ("contextual") harmonisation of digital objects for a common purpose. It also provides an opportunity to structure unstructured data while offering a long-term solution for data language unification within and across distributed data ecosystems. Pending successful data harmonisation within a distributed data ecosystem, content provided by “overlays” underpins structured search queries for improved insights and analytics.

These “Overlays” define individual semantic tasks, which, when combined, provide additional context to the object. An OCA bundle consists of a “Capture Base” and “Overlays”. The sum of its parts represents a contextually-rich schema.</p><p>The segregation of overlays by task enables interoperability in the construction process of any digital object without compromising the integrity of the semantic structure, modular components, or the relationship between those objects.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="Overlays to form"><em>Figure 2. Semantic interoperability. Segregating task-specific objects (overlays) within a standard architecture enables different authorised controllers to update specific structural, definitional, or contextual components of the same semantic structure.</em></p><p>OCA is ontology-agnostic, offering a harmonisation solution between data models and data representation formats while providing a roadmap to resolve privacy-compliant data sharing between servers, networks, and across sectoral or jurisdictional boundaries.</p><p>The deterministic interplay between overlays combined with the unicity of the composite bundle is proving to be an exciting field of research.</p><h2 id="benefits" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#benefits"><span>Benefits</span></a></h2><p>OCA offers many advantages, including:</p><ul><li>Simplified data pooling. Decoupling can occur at any time as overlays are linked objects. With all colouration definitions stored in the overlays, combining data from related sources becomes seamless. Overlays can be removed from the base objects before the data merging process and reapplied to ensure consistent colouration post data pooling.</li><li>Stable capture bases. Most schema updates occur at the application stage. In the case of OCA, all extension and colouration definitions are applied in the overlays, enabling issuers to edit one or more of the linked objects to create simple updates rather than reissue capture bases on an ongoing basis.</li><li>Flagged attributes for encryption. By referencing the Blinding Identity Taxonomy (BIT), issuers can flag attributes in the capture base that could potentially unblind the identity of a governing entity. With attributes flagged at the base object layer, all corresponding data can be treated as sensitive throughout a data lifecycle and encrypted or removed at any stage, making associated governing entity identification impossible.</li><li>Data decentralisation. Capture base definitions can remain in their purest form as a standard base to decentralise data. Thus, once the data holder has given adequate consent, data controllers can contribute anonymous data upon which 3rd parties can trigger granular criteria searches for matched data, eliminating the need for data silos and encouraging consented data sharing. In addition, self-determination regarding the secondary use of personal data empowers the data holder.</li><li>Internationalisation. A separate linked data object captures character set encoding definitions. Thus, a single report definition c:qaan contain different attribute forms for different languages available to users, based on a user&#39;s locale and other language preferences.</li></ul><h2 id="concepts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#concepts"><span>Concepts</span></a></h2><p>OCA follows a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_centric_networking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">content centric networking</a> (CCN) approach by utilzing <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ssmith-said" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Self-Addressing Identifiers</a> (SAID) for deterministic content identification. For that reason OCA strongly relies on cryptographic security characteristics. Each OCA object is equipped with a SAID, which is cryptographically bound to the content of the object. SAID assures immutability and is deterministically generated directly from the content.
