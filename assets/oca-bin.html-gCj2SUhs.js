It offers a range of commands to manage both OCAFiles and OCA Bundles, streamlining the workflow for OCA-based projects. Internally, OCA Bin replicates functionality similar to an OCA Repo, resembling the experience of working with a Git repository. Its command set supports local OCAFile development and testing, enabling fast iteration and reducing the feedback loop for developers.</p><h2 id="installation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#installation"><span>Installation</span></a></h2><p>The OCA Bin is distributed as a standalone executable. You can download the latest version from the <a href="https://github.com/THCLab/oca-bin/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OCA Bin GitHub Releases</a> page.</p><h2 id="workflows" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#workflows"><span>Workflows</span></a></h2><h3 id="overlayfile" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#overlayfile"><span>Overlayfile</span></a></h3><p>The <strong>OCA Bin</strong> leverages the overlay file definitions to manage and validate the <code>OCAfiles</code>. The tool comes with built-in core overlays that are automatically available in the local registry.</p><p>You can check the location of your local registry by running the command <code>oca-bin config</code>. The output will include the following line:</p><div class="language-text line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="text"><pre><code class="language-text"><span class="line">overlay_definition_path = &#39;~/.oca/overlay_definitions/&#39;</span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>You can modify this path in the <code>config.toml</code> file, the location of which is also included in the output of the <code>oca-bin config</code> command.</p><p>See <a href="/ecosystem/overlayfile">Overlayfile</a> for more information.</p><h3 id="ocafile-development" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ocafile-development"><span>OCAFile development</span></a></h3><p>When working with an <strong>OCAFile</strong>, a typical workflow involves making changes, validating the OCAFile&#39;s correctness, and repeating as necessary. Once finalized, the OCAFile can be built and published to the OCA Repo. The commands <code>validate</code>, <code>build</code>, and <code>publish</code> are integrated directly into <strong>OCA Bin</strong> to streamline this process.</p><h3 id="continuous-integration-continuous-deployment-ci-cd-pipeline" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#continuous-integration-continuous-deployment-ci-cd-pipeline"><span>Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline</span></a></h3><p>The <a href="#ocafiles-organization">OCAFiles organization</a> section covers various options for storing OCAFiles. To ensure accuracy and enable additional automated processes when a (sub)set of OCAFiles changes, <strong>OCA Bin</strong> integrates seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines.</p><p>The following pipeline setup can be implemented to maintain OCAFile accuracy:</p><ol><li>When a subset of OCAFiles changes (e.g., within a Git commit), the pipeline runs <code>oca build -d &lt;directory&gt; --diff</code> with <strong>OCA Bin</strong> to validate and build the modified OCAFiles. The <code>--diff</code> flag ensures that only the changed OCAFiles have been processed since the last build.</li><li>If the previous step succeeds and the changes are validated, the pipeline can mark them as ready for the next stage, such as merging the pull request in GitHub or adding a <code>+1</code> score in Gerrit.</li><li>Finally, the pipeline can publish the OCAFiles to the OCA Repo using <code>oca publish -d &lt;directory&gt;</code>.</li></ol><h2 id="concepts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#concepts"><span>Concepts</span></a></h2><h3 id="local-state" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#local-state"><span>Local state</span></a></h3><p>OCA Bin keeps config and its local state within <code>~/.oca</code> directory.</p><h3 id="cache" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cache"><span>Cache</span></a></h3><p>When the <code>-d &lt;directory&gt;</code> option is used, <strong>OCA Bin</strong> creates a cache directory, <code>.oca-bin</code>, relative to the specified <code>&lt;directory&gt;</code>. This directory stores intermediate files generated by the <code>build</code> command, enhancing the efficiency of both the <code>build</code> and <code>publish</code> commands by preventing redundant reprocessing of OCAFiles.</p><h3 id="ocafile-and-oca-bundle" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ocafile-and-oca-bundle"><span>OCAFile and OCA Bundle</span></a></h3><p>An <strong>OCAFile</strong> is the entry point for modeling within the OCA Ecosystem. Using its Domain-Specific Language (DSL) enables the creation of complex data models. On the other hand, the <strong>OCA Bundle</strong> is the end product of the OCAFile, providing integrity to the OCA Ecosystem. This integrity property ensures that any OCA Bundle remains untampered and safeguarded through hashes generated by one-way hash functions. These hashes are embedded directly into the Bundles.</p><h3 id="ocafiles-organization" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ocafiles-organization"><span>OCAFiles organization</span></a></h3><p>When managing an extensive collection of OCAFiles, it&#39;s often beneficial to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Version_control_system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Version Control System (VCS)</a>, such as Git, to track changes and maintain organized control. OCA Bin operates under the assumption that a complete data model can be structured with OCAFiles and, therefore, includes a <code>-d</code> flag across multiple commands to specify the directory containing these files. This approach facilitates efficient management of all files in the specified directory, mainly for validation, building, and publishing tasks.</p>`,26)])])}const l=a(o,[["render",s]]),d=JSON.parse('{"path":"/ecosystem/oca-bin.html","title":"OCA Bin","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{},"git":{"updatedTime":1768846644000,"contributors":[{"name":"Robert Mitwicki","username":"","email":"robert.mitwicki@humancolossus.org","commits":1}],"changelog":[{"hash":"89b83130bafb30969f0ffab4cd17946b862cd43f","time":1768846644000,"email":"robert.mitwicki@humancolossus.org","author":"Robert Mitwicki","message":"Update examples in ocafile ecosystem"}]},"filePathRelative":"ecosystem/oca-bin.md"}');export{l as comp,d as data};
