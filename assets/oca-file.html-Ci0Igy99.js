Recall that a provenance log is an append-only log that consists of items, where each new item is defined as follows: <code>digest(previous item) | current item</code>. Calculating the digest upon it gives the current item (layer) digest. See <a href="/en/HCF/Technologies/OCA/OCAfile/design#layers-step-by-step">below</a> for a step-by-step example.</p><p>As digests determine layers, any new OCA Bundle construct might already benefit from a previously defined OCA Bundle. That is because both OCA Bundles might involve the same attribute names, for example. The directed acyclic graph keeps the layers in vertices (their digests). It ensures the unambiguous resolution of any layer.</p><h3 id="text-based-format" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#text-based-format"><span>Text based format</span></a></h3><p>The OCAfile remains text based for readability</p><h3 id="pleasant-dsl" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pleasant-dsl"><span>Pleasant DSL</span></a></h3><p>The OCAfile relies on a domain-specific language (DSL) that is human and machine-readable to achieve deterministic layering.
